This list of radars in the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) system is derived from two **files maintained by NOAA** for their [radar map](https://www.weather.gov/nl2/NEXRADView). Issues can be reported to [Alex Tedeschi](mailto:alexander.tedeschi@cornell.edu).

Metadata were last downloaded on 2026-01-25, processed using [this script](https://github.com/aloftdata/aloftdata.eu/blob/main/_data/OPERA_RADARS_DB.R) and resulted into [this JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aloftdata/aloftdata.eu/main/_data/OPERA_RADARS_DB.json). Only radars with an ODIM code are shown. Status `0` indicates that the radar is no longer active. Note that [bird movement data](https://crow.aloftdata.eu/) is not available for all radars listed on this page.
